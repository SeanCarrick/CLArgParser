# `CLArgParser`
`CLArgParser` is yet another command line argument parsing tool for Java programs. However, `CLArgParser` aims to be simplistic in its design and use, so that it's not like learning another language to be able to successfully use it.

## Timeline
### September 13, 2020
Created a release of the `CLArgParser` utility. I decided that an actual release should be made at this point, as I've used this library within my own projects over the past year and have had no issues with it. I figured that would be the best possible way to test it out to make sure there are no bugs.

Feel free to download [Release 0.5.127](https://github.com/SeanCarrick/CLArgParser/releases/tag/0.5.127) from the releases page. If you find any [bugs](https://github.com/SeanCarrick/CLArgParser/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title="[BUG]"), have any issues, or have any [feature requests](https://github.com/SeanCarrick/CLArgParser/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title="[RFE]"), please feel free to submit them through the Issues tab on this repository.

### October 2, 2019
`CLArgParser` is **complete**! The [JAR file is available in the `dist` folder](https://github.com/SeanCarrick/CLArgParser/raw/master/dist/ISCommandLineParser.jar) on the repository. It is, I believe, ready for prime time. If you use it and have any issues, please file an Issue for it, so that I can make it right. Also, if you have any feature requests, feel free to let me know by completing a Feature Request. When submitting Issues or Feature Requests, please use the templates. I hope you enjoy this simple way of parsing your command line arguments for your Java programs!

### September 30, 2019
`CLArgParser` is in its infacy, as I've just started working on it and have yet to even set up my project for it. However, I wanted to get my GitHub repository set up for it before starting, so that as soon as I have a project and some initial code, I can upload it here, so that I can work on it where ever I may be.
