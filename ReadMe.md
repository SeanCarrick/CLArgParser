# `CLArgParser`
`CLArgParser` is yet another command line argument parsing tool for Java programs. However, `CLArgParser` aims to be simplistic in its design and use, so that it's not like learning another language to be able to successfully use it.

## Timeline
`CLArgParser` is in its infacy, as I've just started working on it and have yet to even set up my project for it. However, I wanted to get my GitHub repository set up for it before starting, so that as soon as I have a project and some initial code, I can upload it here, so that I can work on it where ever I may be.
